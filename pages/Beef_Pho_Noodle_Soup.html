<p dir="ltr">Viet</p>
<br/><H2><p dir="ltr">For the broth:</p>
</H2><p dir="ltr">3 medium yellow onions (about 1 pound total)</p>
<p dir="ltr">4-inch piece ginger (about 4 ounces)</p>
<p dir="ltr">5-6 pounds beef soup bones (leg bone and knuckle bones)</p>
<p dir="ltr">5 star anise (40 star points total)</p>
<p dir="ltr">6 whole cloves</p>
<p dir="ltr">3-inch cinnamon stick</p>
<p dir="ltr">1 pound piece of beef chuck, rump, brisket or cross rib roast, cut into 2-by-4-inch pieces (weight after trimming)</p>
<p dir="ltr">1 1/2 tablespoons salt</p>
<p dir="ltr">6 tablespoons fish sauce</p>
<p dir="ltr">6 pieces of yellow rock sugar</p>
<H2><p dir="ltr">For the bowls:</p>
</H2><p dir="ltr">1 1/2-2 pounds small (1/8-inch wide) dried or fresh banh pho noodles ("rice sticks'' or Thaichantaboon)</p>
<p dir="ltr">1/2 pound raw eye of round, sirloin, London broil or tri-tip steak, thinly sliced across the grain (1/16 inch thick; freeze for 15 minutes to make it easier to slice)</p>
<p dir="ltr">1 medium yellow onion, sliced paper-thin, left to soak for 30 minutes in a bowl of cold water</p>
<p dir="ltr">3 or 4 scallions, green part only, cut into thin rings</p>
<p dir="ltr">1/3 cup chopped cilantro (ngo)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ground black pepper</p>
<p dir="ltr">Optional garnishes arranged on a plate and placed at the table:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sprigs of spearmint (hung lui) and Asian/Thai basil (hung que)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Leaves of thorny cilantro (ngo gai)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bean sprouts (about 1/2 pound)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Red hot chiles (such as Thai bird or dragon), thinly sliced</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lime wedges</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let cool. Under warm water, remove charred onion skin; trim and discard blackened parts of root or stem ends. If ginger skin is puckered and blistered, smash ginger with flat side of knife to loosen flesh from skin. Otherwise, use sharp paring knife to remove skin, running ginger under warm water to wash off blackened bits. Set aside.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Parboil bones. Place bones in stockpot (minimum 12-quart capacity) and cover with cold water. Over high heat, bring to boil. Boil vigorously 2 to 3 minutes to allow impurities to be released. Dump bones and water into sink and rinse bones with warm water. Quickly scrub stockpot to remove any residue. Return bones to pot.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Simmer broth. Add 6 quarts water to pot, bring to boil over high heat, then lower flame to gently simmer. Use ladle to skim any scum that rises to surface. Add remaining broth ingredients and cook, uncovered, for 1 1/2 hours. Boneless meat should be slightly chewy but not tough. When it is cooked to your liking, remove it and place in bowl of cold water for 10 minutes; this prevents the meat from drying up and turning dark as it cools. Drain the meat; cool, then refrigerate. Allow broth to continue cooking; in total, the broth should simmer 3 hours.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Strain the pho broth through fine strainer. If desired, remove any bits of gelatinous tendon from bones to add to your pho bowl. Store tendon with cooked beef. Discard solids.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Use ladle to skim as much fat from top of the pho broth as you like. (Cool it and refrigerate it overnight to make this task easier; reheat befofe continuing.) Taste and adjust flavor with additional salt, fish sauce and yellow rock sugar. The pho broth should taste slightly too strong because the noodles and other ingredients are not salted. (If you've gone too far, add water to dilute.) Makes about 4 quarts.</p>
<H2><p dir="ltr">Assemble pho bowls:</p>
</H2><p dir="ltr">Heat the pho broth and ready the noodles. To ensure good timing, reheat broth over medium flame as you're assembling bowls. If you're using dried noodles, cover with hot tap water and soak 15-20 minutes, until softened and opaque white. Drain in colander. For fresh rice noodles, just untangle and briefly rinse in a colander with cold water.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Blanch noodles. Fill 3- or 4-quart saucepan with water and bring to boil. For each bowl, use long-handle strainer to blanch a portion of noodles. As soon as noodles have collapsed and lost their stiffness (10-20 seconds), pull strainer from water, letting water drain back into saucepan. Empty noodles into bowls. Noodles should occupy 1/4 to 1/3 of bowl; the latter is for noodle lovers, while the former is for those who prize broth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If desired, after blanching noodles, blanch bean sprouts for 30 seconds in same saucepan. They should slightly wilt but retain some crunch. Drain and add to the garnish plate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Add other ingredients. Place slices of cooked meat, raw meat and tendon (if using) atop noodles. (If your cooked meat is not at room temperature, blanch slices for few seconds in hot water from above.) Garnish with onion, scallion and chopped cilantro. Finish with black pepper.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ladle in broth and serve. Bring broth to rolling boil. Check seasoning. Ladle broth into each bowl, distributing hot liquid evenly so as to cook raw beef and warm other ingredients. Serve your pho with with the garnish plate.</p>
