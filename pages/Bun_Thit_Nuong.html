<p dir="ltr">Viet</p>
<br/><p dir="ltr">1.5 lb pork butt/shoulder, thinly sliced just under 1/4 inch. Ask butcher do not use lean pork, it will become to dry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">1/4 cup minced lemongrass</p>
<p dir="ltr">1/4 cup sugar</p>
<p dir="ltr">2 tbs fish sauce</p>
<p dir="ltr">1 tbs ground pepper</p>
<p dir="ltr">2-3 cloves garlic, minced (use more according to taste)</p>
<p dir="ltr">2-3 shallots, minced.</p>
<p dir="ltr">3 tbs sesame oil</p>
<p dir="ltr">1 tbs thick soy sauce (not regular soy sauce&#8211;has molasses, making it thicker and adding great color. If not available, can use caramel sauce. Both can be found at Asian groceries)</p>
<p dir="ltr">3 tbs roasted sesame</p>
<p dir="ltr">1 14 oz. package of vermicelli</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thit nuong (above)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fresh herbs: Mint (rau thom), Perilla (tia to), beansprouts (gia)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cucumber, diced matchstick size</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lettuce, thinly chopped</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pickled carrots and daikons</p>
<p dir="ltr">Roasted peanuts, coarsely crushed</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scallion oil ( 2 tbs chop scallions and to that, add about 2 tbs of hot olive oil and pinch of sugar and salt)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cut any large pieces of sliced pork into roughly 2-3 inch strips. Again, not too small as you do not want it to dry out and also so that it doesn&#8217;t fall through the grilling basket. For best results grill outdoors using a flexible grilling basket. Grilling on an indoor grill however, is perfectly acceptable.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For the marinade, combine in large mixing bowl the lemongrass, shallots, garlic, sugar, fish sauce, pepper, dark soy sauce, sesame oil. Add pork and mix well and marinade for at least 1-2 hrs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Spread out the meat loosely mesh and grill until nicely golden brown and slightly charred. To prevent from over drying since the meat is so thinly slice, keep lid on the grill. Remove from mesh basket into platter or bowl and toss with roasted sesame. Of course your can use an indoor grill or even saute in a pan if these options aren&#8217;t available.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dipping fish sauce (nuoc mam cham)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Place vermicelli in boiling water for about 6-8 min, stirring regularly so it won&#8217;t stick to the bottom of the pot. To check for doneness, take a strand and taste. Should be still slightly firm but easily breaks apart. Drain and flush with cold water to stop cooking process.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In large bowl, combine vermicelli with grilled pork (thit nuong) lots fresh herbs, cucumbers, beansprouts, pickled carrots and daikon, crushed roasted peanuts, scallion oil and dress with nuoc mam cham (dipping fish sauce).</p>
