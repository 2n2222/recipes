<p dir="ltr">Tide and Thyme</p>
<p dir="ltr">1 medium onion , chopped fine</p>
<p dir="ltr">1 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p dir="ltr">3 medium cloves garlic , minced</p>
<p dir="ltr">3 tbsp. taco seasoning</p>
<p dir="ltr">2 cups Paul Newman's tomato sauce</p>
<p dir="ltr">1 cup water</p>
<p dir="ltr">1 lb ground turkey</p>
<p dir="ltr">6 slices of American cheese</p>

<p dir="ltr">6&nbsp; (10 in )soft flour tortillas</p>
<p dir="ltr">Vegetable cooking spray</p>
<p dir="ltr">Salt</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ground black pepper</p>
<p dir="ltr">1. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 425 degrees. Combine the onion, oil, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large saucepan. Cover and cook over medium-low heat, stirring often, until the onions have softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the garlic, 2 tblsp of the taco seasoning, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the tomato sauce and water, bring to a simmer, and cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. Strain the sauce through a medium-mesh strainer into a medium bowl, pressing on the onions to extract as much liquid as possible. Place onion mixture in a large bowl and set aside. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste. clean out sauce pan, place 1 tbsp of oil and throw in ground turkey when half cooked mix in the onion mixture.</p>
<p dir="ltr">3- Add in 1/4 cup enchilada sauce to combine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">4. Stack the tortillas on a microwave-safe plate, cover with plastic wrap, and microwave on high until warm and pliable, 40 to 60 seconds. Spread the warm tortillas out over a clean work surface. Place 1/2 cup of the turkey mixture evenly down the center of each tortilla place half slice of American cheese on top following with chopped cilantro.&nbsp; Tightly roll each tortilla around the filling and lay them seam-side down in a 13 by 9-inch baking dish.</p>
<p dir="ltr">5. Lightly spray the tops of the enchiladas with vegetable oil spray. Place in the oven, uncovered, for about 7 minutes until the tortillas are starting to slightly brown on the top. (If you dont&#8217; like a bit of crunch in your enchiladas, just skip this step completely)</p>
<p dir="ltr">6. Reduce oven temperature to 400. Remove enchiladas from oven and pour remaining sauce over to coat them thoroughly. Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup cheddar down the center of the enchiladas. Cover the baking dish with foil and bake until the enchiladas are heated through, 20 to 25 minutes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">7. Remove the foil and continue to bake until the cheese browns, about 5 minutes longer. Remove from oven and let stand for 10 minutes before serving. top with sour cream (optional)</p>
